## Building a deep artificial neural network to estimate the approximate location of housing

## blocks.

The	objective	of	this	activity	is	to	follow	the	construction	process	of	a	deep	artificial	neural	network for	
a classification	problem using	the	California	Housing	Prices	dataset.	

This	classification	problem	 consists	 of estimating	 the	approximate	location	of	housing	blocks.	The	
approximate	location	is	represented	with	a	discrete	variable called	ocean_proximity	which	may	have	
one	of	four possible	values:	NEAR	BAY, <1H	OCEAN,	INLAND,	and	NEAR	OCEAN.


1. **Prepare	the environment for	Python	3	with	Tensorflow	and	Keras.	** You	 can	 choose	 any	
    development	environment,	 such	 as	 PyCharm速 IDE	 (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/),	
    Atom速	(https://atom.io),	Anaconda速 distribution	(https://www.anaconda.com/download/),	
    although	 Google	 Colab速	 is	 encouraged	 since	 it requires	 no	 setup:

2. **Construct a deep	 neural	 network**. Write a	 notebook	 implementing	 first	 the	 data	 loading	
    process	of	the	two	.csv	files,	attributes, and	classes.	Then,	split	the	dataset	into	three	partitions	
    80%	of	the	whole	dataset	for	training,	10%	for	development	testing,	and	the	remaining	10%	for	
    final	testing	purposes.	Finally,	follow	the	deep-neural-network	construction	process	to	find	out	
    the	neural	architecture	and	its hyperparameters	to achieve	the	best	performance	regarding	the
